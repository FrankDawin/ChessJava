if piece == "r"

How to remember move for pieces?

-do each piece knows?
-Does the game knows?
-how it is stored


for each square 64 (8x8)
for each piece
32 pieces (2x16)

16 pieces
fen - all move
square --> identify piece --> list

IA needs movement in advance, game don't

if move(x,y,x,y)
identify the piece --> make a list of move --> if movement illegal --> block


for movement what do you need, all pattern regardless of board. because move strike out of bound
